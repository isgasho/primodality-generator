# primodality-generator
Takes primes as input to generate primodal .scl files.

**Primodality** is a new category of digital harmony space conceived of by [Zheanna Erose](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC--VosYH0BHISbb4SFO9rQA).

A unique primodal scale exists for every conceivable prime. *n*-primodality is the set of all rational numbers where the denominator is *n* and the numerator *a* is greater than or equal to *n*. Particularly of interest is the subset where n â‰¤ a < 8n, which always contains a just fifth. This is the range for which this program produces a .scl file.

This program is run via command line. It accepts primes greater than 2 that fit in an unsigned 32-bit integer. I've produced a portable linux binary which can be found in the builds directory. If you have any questions, reach out on [twitter](twitter.com/thenorili)!
